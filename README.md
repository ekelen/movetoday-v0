# Move Today

> Wake up & train handstands ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Brainless workout sequence generator** for my own groggy morning bodyweight training purposes, and a workspace to test [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the [Vercel cloud platform](https://vercel.com), G----- Lighthouse CI, and [Tailwind CSS v2](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Todo:

- [ ] Interactive buttons
- [ ] Done state for moves
- [ ] Progress bar in sequence
- [ ] A comfortably large timer
- [ ] Color-coded move focus tags

And overall theme improvement, if I continue to use this.
