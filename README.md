üîó **[https://movetoday-v0.vercel.app/](https://movetoday-v0.vercel.app/)**

**Brainless workout sequence generator** for my own groggy morning bodyweight training purposes, and a workspace to test [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the [Vercel cloud platform](https://vercel.com), G----- Lighthouse CI, and [Tailwind CSS v2](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Todo:

- [x] Interactive buttons
- [x] Done state for moves
- [x] Progress bar in sequence
- [ ] A comfortably large timer
- [ ] Color-coded move focus tags
- [ ] Transitions
- [ ] Clearer UI (scroll direction inidicators on hover, for example)

And overall theme improvement, if I continue to use this.
